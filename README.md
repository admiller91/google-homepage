The Odin Project - Google Homepage



Lessons Learned:
    Using flexbox to organize html elements
    Responsive layout in the footer
        Changing the order of elements, their direction, and the wrap
    Using a CSS reset and HTML boilerplate to start the project
    Using develper tools to find colors, fizes, font family, padding, and other
        general layout tips


For future projects:
    is it easier to use grid instead of flexbox?
    checkout other boilerplates and css reset files
    better naming conventions?
        css was targeting items using > too much. should give things
            classes/id's to make it easier
