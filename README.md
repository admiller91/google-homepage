The Odin Project - Google Homepage



Lessons Learned:
    *Using flexbox to organize html elements
    *Responsive layout in the footer
        Changing the order of elements, their direction, and the wrap
    *Using a CSS reset and HTML boilerplate to start the project
    *Using develper tools to find colors, fizes, font family, padding, and other
        general layout tips
    *Using Live Server to develop faster
    *Using Git and Github for the entire project


For future projects:
    *is it easier to use grid instead of flexbox?
    *checkout other boilerplates and css reset files
    *better naming conventions?
        css was targeting items using > too much. should give things
            classes/id's to make it easier
    *use Git more often with smaller changes instead of
        doing the 2nd half of the project without commiting
    *did i use the right html elements (section) for each section of the site
        besides the nav and footer. use divs instead?
